## Run the app

Run the app (<kbd>F5</kbd> on Visual Studio) and observe the UI, it should look similar to the following:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../../../art/Dark/app-looks.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="../../../art/Light/app-looks.png">
  <img alt="Calculator UI while the app is running" src="../../../art/Light/app-looks.png">
</picture>

## Next Step

The next module offers an alternative way to import the UI code without Figma. Since you've already imported the UI, you may skip to Module 4, where you will add the app architecture.
