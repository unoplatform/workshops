# Importing UI from Figma

In this module, you will learn how to import the UI from Figma.  
Figma is a collaborative app UI design tool that allows users to create, share, and comment on designs in real-time. It then allows exporting the UI in selected markup language for developers to carry on with the pre-designed app.

Uno Platform offers a Figma plugin that enables exporting the UI designed in Figma as both XAML and C# Markup.
In this module, you'll learn how to export the UI from a pre-existing Figma design for the SimpleCalculator app, and how to import it into the app you've started to create in the previous modules.

## Opening the Figma file and setting up an account

1. Use [this link](https://aka.platform.uno/uno-figma-simplecalc-workshop) to access the Figma file for the Simple Calculator project. The link will take you to the Simple Calculator community file, where you can proceed to open it in Figma.
