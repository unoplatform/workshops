## Customizing the Color Palette

So far we have the default Uno Material color palette from `Uno.Material` with some overrides from the new app template. We can further customize the color palette by updating the color overrides in the Styles folder of our SimpleCalculator project.

- [ColorPaletteOverride.xaml](../../../resources/ColorPaletteOverride.xaml)

With the color palette updated, we can now run the app again to see the updated look for our calculator. The final result will be similar to the image below:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../../../art/Dark/iphone14.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="../../../art/Light/iphone14.png">
  <img alt="Final Result" src="../../../art/Light/iphone14.png">
</picture>

## Next Steps

Congratulations you have now created your first Uno app! The four permutations of the SimpleCalculator can be found within our [Uno.Samples GitHub Repository](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples/tree/master/reference/simple-calc).

To continue to learn more about Uno Platform be sure to check out the [Uno Platform documentation](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started.html) and the [Uno Platform samples](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples).
