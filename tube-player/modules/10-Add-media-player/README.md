# Module 10 - Add a media player

In this module, you'll download streaming video data from YouTube and integrate into the app a media player element that can play it.  
You'll also learn how to interact with the media player and stop the video when navigating away from the video player page.

## Add YouTube video streaming endpoint API

1. Open the folder *Services/Models* and add a file named *PlayerModels.cs* with the following content:

    ```csharp
    public partial record Format(string? Url, string? QualityLabel);
    
    public partial record StreamingData(List<Format>? Formats);
    
    public partial record YoutubeData(StreamingData? StreamingData);
    ```

1. Add a file named *IYoutubePlayerEndpoint.cs* to the *Services* folder with the following content:

    ```csharp
    [Headers(
        "Content-Type: application/json",
        "User-Agent", "com.google.android.youtube/17.36.4 (Linux; U; Android 12; GB) gzip")]
    public interface IYoutubePlayerEndpoint
    {
        [Post("/player")]
        Task<ApiResponse<YoutubeData>> GetStreamData([Body] string data, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    }
    ```

## Register Refit endpoint

The previous interface is a Refit service. You will now register it with Refit. Open *App.xaml.cs*, and add the following Refit client registration right after the previous one you added earlier:

```diff
 services
     .AddRefitClientWithEndpoint<IYoutubeEndpoint, YoutubeEndpointOptions>(
         context,
         configure: (clientBuilder, options) => clientBuilder
             .ConfigureHttpClient(httpClient =>
             {
                 httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(options!.Url!);
                 httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-goog-api-key", options.ApiKey);
             }))
+    .AddRefitClient<IYoutubePlayerEndpoint>(context);
```

## Update `IYoutubeService` interface

1. Open the *IYoutubeService.cs* file and add the following method to the interface:

    ```csharp
    Task<string?> GetVideoSourceUrl(string userId, CancellationToken ct);
    ```

## Update `YoutubeService` to use `IYoutubePlayerEndpoint`

1. Open the *YoutubeService.cs* file

1. Update the `YoutubeService` Primary Constructor by adding a new parameter of type `IYoutubePlayerEndpoint`:

    ```diff
   - public class YoutubeService(IYoutubeEndpoint client) : IYoutubeService
   + public class YoutubeService(IYoutubeEndpoint client, IYoutubePlayerEndpoint playerClient) : IYoutubeService
    {
        ...
    }
    ```

1. Implement the method added to the interface using the following code:

    ```csharp
    public async Task<string?> GetVideoSourceUrl(string videoId, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var streamVideo = $$"""
                {
                    "videoId": "{{videoId}}",
                    "context": {
                        "client": {
                            "clientName": "ANDROID_TESTSUITE",
                            "clientVersion": "1.9",
                            "androidSdkVersion": 30,
                            "hl": "en",
                            "gl": "US",
                            "utcOffsetMinutes": 0
                        }
                    }
                }
                """;

        // Get the available stream data
        var streamData = await playerClient.GetStreamData(streamVideo, ct);

        // Get the video stream with the highest video quality
        var streamWithHighestVideoQuality = streamData.Content?.
                                                        StreamingData?
                                                        .Formats?
                                                        .OrderByDescending(s => s.QualityLabel)
                                                        .FirstOrDefault();

        // Get the stream URL
        var streamUrl = streamWithHighestVideoQuality?.Url;

        return streamUrl;
    }
    ```

## Utilize `IYoutubeService` in `VideoDetailsModel`

1. Open the file *VideoDetailsModel.cs* and add a property of type `IYoutubeService` named `YoutubeService` to it (via the record constructor, like the `Video` property):

    ```csharp
    public partial record VideoDetailsModel(YoutubeVideo Video, IYoutubeService YoutubeService)
    ```

1. Add the following method to the record:

    ```csharp
    private async ValueTask<MediaSource> GetVideoSource(CancellationToken ct)
    {
         var streamUrl = await YoutubeService.GetVideoSourceUrl(Video?.Id, ct) ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Input stream collection is empty.");
    
        // Return the MediaSource using the stream URL
        return MediaSource.CreateFromUri(new Uri(streamUrl));
    }
    ```

1. Replace the `VideoSource` property declaration line with the following:

    ```csharp
    public IFeed<MediaSource> VideoSource => Feed.Async(GetVideoSource);
    ```

## Update the `YoutubeServiceMock`

Since we updated the `IYoutubeService` interface, we need to update the mock implementation as well.

1. Open the *YoutubeServiceMock.cs* file and add the following method to the class:

    ```csharp
    public Task<string?> GetVideoSourceUrl(string videoId, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return Task.FromResult<string?>(default);
    }  
    ```

## Add Player to layout

1. Open the *VideoDetailsPage.cs* file, and add the following variable to the top of the file (right after class opening):

    ```csharp
    private MediaPlayerElement? youtubePlayer;
    ```

1. Add the `Assign` extension method to the `MediaPlayerElement`, so that it can be accessed outside this scope, as well as the `AutoPlay` and `Source` extension methods:

    ```diff
     new MediaPlayerElement()
    +    .Assign(mediaPlayerElement => youtubePlayer = mediaPlayerElement)
    +    .AutoPlay(true)
    +    .Source(() => vm.VideoSource)
    +    .PosterSource(() => vm.Video.Details.Snippet?.Thumbnails?.Medium?.Url!)
         ...
    ```

## Pause the video when returning to the search results page

When the user navigates back to the search results page, the media player continues to play the video. To avoid that, implement the `OnNavigatingFrom` method in *VideoDetailsPage.cs* as follows:

```csharp
protected async override void OnNavigatingFrom(NavigatingCancelEventArgs e)
{
    base.OnNavigatingFrom(e);

    youtubePlayer?.MediaPlayer.Pause();
}
```

## Add MediaElement Feature

You can set up the **MediaElement** [UnoFeature](xref:Uno.Features.Uno.Sdk) in a few ways. During project setup, pick 'Media Element' under 'Features' in the wizard. Or, use the CLI with the right parameter during project creation. Also you can add it manually later in the project file.

Here's how to do it now:

1. Open the TubePlayer.csproj file.
2. Locate the "UnoFeatures" property within the "PropertyGroup" section.
3. Add "MediaElement" to the list of features, as shown in the snippet below:

```diff
    <UnoFeatures>
      <!-- Other features here-->
+     MediaElement; 
    </UnoFeatures>
```

## Run the app

Run the app to see the media player playing the video from YouTube. Seek, volume, pause, and other controls are built into the media player.

![Video opens and plays](ui-output.gif)

You will notice how the video stops before navigating back to the search results (observe the play button right before the navigation happens), but at the same time, we still want to update the navigation bar image (currently a random picture), the app icon, as well as the splashscreen (which are currently set to the template defaults).

> [!NOTE]
> In order to be able to play the media in WASM, because of a CORS issue, you will need to either create a server project (e.g. using [YARP](https://chat.openai.com/share/d633a7b6-1b3c-4730-a60b-96dfd97baa0a)) or by using a public proxy (e.g. using [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)).

For more information on `MediaPlayerElement` support, refer to the [MediaPlayerElement documentation](https://aka.platform.uno/mediaplayerelement).
