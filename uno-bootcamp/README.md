# Workshop: Uno Bootcamp

## Overview

With the [Uno Platform][uno-platform], you can empower your existing .NET teams to build beautiful and performant, single codebase, cross-platform web, mobile, and desktop apps. In this single-day intensive workshop, we’re going to introduce you to the development philosophy of Uno and build a new application from scratch that uses the philosophy. You’ll also learn from the creators of Uno productivity tips and how Uno works under the hood.

## Topics Covered

* Initial developer setup and getting started
* The most productive way to develop an application
* Building an iOS, Android and WebAssembly application with Uno
* Building rich, responsive UI on mobile and web
* Usage of platform-native views and intermixing them
* How Uno works under the hood
* Source level debugging and how to monkey patch Uno’s internals
